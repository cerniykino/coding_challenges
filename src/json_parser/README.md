# JSON Parser

## Project Description

This project is focused on building a JSON parser from scratch.

Building a JSON parser provides a great opportunity to learn about parsing techniques, which are essential for tasks ranging from parsing simple data formats to developing a fully featured compiler for a programming language.

## Parsing Techniques

The process of parsing is typically divided into two stages:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: This stage involves breaking down a sequence of characters into meaningful chunks, called tokens.
2. **Syntactic Analysis**: Also known as parsing, this stage involves analyzing the list of tokens to match them against a formal grammar.
